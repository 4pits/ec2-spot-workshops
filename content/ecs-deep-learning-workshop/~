## Lab 1 - Set up the Workshop Environment on AWS:

1. First, you'll need to select a region. For this lab, you will need to choose either Ohio or Oregon. At the top right hand corner of the AWS Console, you'll see a Support dropdown. To the left of that is the region selection dropdown.

2. Then you'll need to create an SSH key pair which will be used to login to the instances once provisioned. Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click on Key Pairs in the left menu under Network & Security. Click Create Key Pair, provide a name (can be anything, make it something memorable) when prompted, and click Create. Once created, the private key in the form of .pem file will be automatically downloaded.

If you're using linux or mac, change the permissions of the .pem file to be less open.


	$ chmod 400 PRIVATE_KEY.PEM
	
If you're on windows you'll need to convert the .pem file to .ppk to work with putty. Here is a link to instructions for the file conversion - [Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)

3. For your convenience, we provide a CloudFormation template to stand up the core infrastructure.

Prior to launching a stack, be aware that a few of the resources launched need to be manually deleted when the workshop is over. When finished working, please review the "Workshop Cleanup" section to learn what manual teardown is required by you.

Click on one of these CloudFormation templates that matches the region you created your keypair in to launch your stack:
