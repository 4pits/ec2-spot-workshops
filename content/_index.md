### Overview

[Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) offer spare compute capacity available in 
the AWS cloud at steep discounts compared to On-Demand instances. Spot Instances enable you to optimize 
your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your application's throughput up to 10X for the same budget.

Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with two minutes of notification when EC2 needs the capacity 
back. You can use Spot Instances for various fault-tolerant and flexible applications, such as 
big data, containerized workloads, high-performance computing (HPC), stateless web servers, rendering, 
CI/CD and other test & development workloads. 

Spot Instances are tightly integrated with other AWS services including EMR, Auto Scaling, Elastic Container Service (ECS), CloudFormation, Data Pipeline and AWS Batch, providing freedom of choice in how you launch and maintain your applications running on Spot Instances.

This website contains a set of different hands-on workshops designed for you to get familiar with EC2
Spot Instances and how to use them in different scenarios, with different AWS services. The workshops 
are also designed to highlight best practices to follow when using EC2 Spot instances in your 
applications and workloads.
