In order to execute the steps in the workshop, you'll need to clone the workshop GitHub repo.


1. In the Cloud9 IDE terminal, run the following command:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-workshops.git
	```
	
1. Change into the workshop directory:

	```
	cd ec2-spot-workshops/workshops/running-amazon-ec2-workloads-at-scale
	```

1. Feel free to browse around. You can also browse the directory structure in the **Environment** tab on the left, and even edit files directly there by double clicking on them.
