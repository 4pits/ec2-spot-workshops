In order to execute the steps in the workshop, you'll need to clone the workshop GitHub repo.

{{% notice note %}}
TEMPORARILY because we don't yet have the new location for the github repo, if you want to run through the workshop use this git location and directory instead of the ones further down the page:\
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-labs.git\  
cd ec2-spot-labs/workshops/running-amazon-ec2-workloads-at-scale\
{{% /notice %}}

1. In the Cloud9 IDE terminal, run the following command:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/awslabs/XXXplaceholderXXX.git
	```
	
1. Change into the workshop directory:

	```
	cd ec2-spot-workshops/workshops/running-amazon-ec2-workloads-at-scale
	```

1. Feel free to browse around. You can also browse the directory structure in the **Environment** tab on the left, and even edit files directly there by double clicking on them.
